# OpenNevadaDataLibrary
To coalesce data sources, useful cleanups &amp; scripts, and share projects in one spot. If you want to be a part of this project or have ideas for manging it, email me. It's better with more people helping! If you have a project you want to add or data we should link to or both, again, email me or pull a PR.
